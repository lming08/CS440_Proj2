• What is the most useful thing you learned in this class?
    - I think I learned the most about python, but from the class material, probably the searching stuff 
• Finish this sentence: If there was more time, I would
have liked to learn more about... (course topic)
    - The machine learning
• Finish this sentence: To make more time, I would have
preferred to see less about... (course topic)
    - I don't know, I thought the spacing was pretty good
• In general, what about the open-ended group projects
did you enjoy most and least? Please be candid.
    - I enjoyed working with a group, especially when they understood python better than I did
• The shared writing, experiments, and analysis in your
project reports were designed to prepare you for rigor-
ous technical writing expected in academia. Whatever
your career goal is, did you find these exercises valu-
able? Do you plan on attending graduate school?
    - I didn't really like the writing part, but then again, I never really liked writing much. I don't know if I want to attend graduate school, or if this will influence my decision
• Did the open-ended group projects change your interest
in pursuing graduate study or addition study in AI? If
so, briefly contrast the experience to routine homework.
    - Not really
